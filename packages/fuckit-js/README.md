# What

A sort of shortcut to use the eslint config `@schlagerkhan/eslint-config-js`.

# Why

Because I got tired of all eslint peerDependencies. It's as far away from best practise as you can come. But fuck it...

# How to use?

1. `yarn install @schlagerkhan/eslint-fuckit-js`
2. In eslint config, extend `@schlagerkhan/js` or `@schlagerkhan/ts/base`
3. Done, simple as fuck

# Other

Checkout `@schlagerkhan/eslint-fuckit-ts` for typescript linting
